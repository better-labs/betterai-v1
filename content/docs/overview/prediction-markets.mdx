# What are Prediction Markets?

Prediction markets are financial markets where people can bet on the outcomes of future events. They harness the "wisdom of crowds" to generate probabilistic forecasts about everything from elections to economic indicators.

## How They Work

1. **Market Creation**: A question is posed (e.g., "Will it rain tomorrow?")
2. **Trading**: People buy and sell shares representing different outcomes
3. **Price Discovery**: Share prices reflect the crowd's collective belief about probability
4. **Resolution**: When the event occurs, winning shares pay out

## Popular Platforms

- **[Polymarket](https://polymarket.com/)**: The largest crypto-based prediction market
- **[Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/)**: CFTC-regulated prediction market for US users

## Why They Matter

Prediction markets often outperform traditional forecasting methods because:

- **Financial Incentives**: Real money encourages careful analysis
- **Aggregated Wisdom**: Many perspectives combined
- **Real-Time Updates**: Prices adjust as new information emerges
- **Track Record**: Historical accuracy can be measured and verified

## The Challenge

While prediction markets are powerful, making good predictions requires:
- Deep research into relevant factors
- Understanding of market dynamics
- Analysis of multiple data sources
- Synthesis of complex information
