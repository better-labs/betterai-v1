# Changelog

## Friday 8/21/25: v0.1 Release


Hello friends üëã

Welcome to the initial v0.1 release of BetterAI!

**v0.1 Features**

For now we have a very minimal working app that shows read only views of predictions for markets on https://polymarket.com/. Next week we'll add the ability for you to trigger new predictions manually.

The app pulls the top 100 markets by volume from https://polymarket.com/ and uses a variety of AI models to generate predictions (high and low quality) multiple times per day.

The AI accuracy is still "under development". The predictions you see on the app are live predictions from the AI models. However, for now they are using minimal data enrichment from the web. We'll improve on this significantly in coming weeks.

**Note:** Mobile view is functional, but may have more UX issues than Desktop.

Cheers üôè
