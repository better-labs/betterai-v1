# Week of 8/11


## Wednesday
- CRON improvements:

    Design a new cron job named daily-update-polymarket-data that runs every day at 12:00 AM UTC. Don't build it yet

    Note: the /events endpoint doesn't have a parameter to filter by recent updates or modifications. The available date filters are start_date_min/max and end_date_min/max, which filter by event start/end dates, not when the event data was last updated.

    have it call updatePolymarketEventsAndMarketData

    give me feedback if we need to change the design of updatePolymarketEventsAndMarketData

    what is the best way to use start_date_min/max and end_date_min/max to ensure coverage of new data from polymarket getEvents, without overloading with too many requests to the api endpoint?

    Move configuration knobs to env vars or encode query params in the cron path, whichever is best practice 

  - Test changes
  - Rename cron job api/cron/generate-batch-predictions/route.ts to api/cron/daily-generate-batch-predictions/route.ts and update all references to it.
  


  - Not sure yet for update-ai-models.js
  - Ask AI to review the current cron jobs and give feedback.






update-polymarket-data: every 4–6 hours for better market coverage.
prediction-check: hourly (or every 30 min) to track drift and outcomes sooner.
generate-batch-predictions: keep daily (quiet hours) unless you need more frequency.






- Ask AI to convert my existing scripts to test or environment smoke tests that can be ran against new builds in Prod. What is a simple best practice?


- rename to .env.development (and .env.prod → .env.production).

- build a cron job that creates a Traditional Daily Dumps (pg_dump) of the production database to vercel blob storage using vercel cron job. build the PR to have specific instructions on how I should set this up in Vercel including env vars



## Thursday
- Account Creation & Authentication: Lightweight login via maybe Clerk or Auth.js or similar. Required for persisting predictions and preparing for payments.  *Alpha note*: Provide a free daily credit pool; skip the funding flow for now. Each new user signup gets 100 free credits, reset daily to at least 100.

- Portfolio Watcher v1: import your active portfolio via public URL from Polymarket only. Enable users to manually select markets and trigger predictions.


### Gating and egress control
- Auth-only access to full context; per-user/IP quotas; no bulk endpoints; HMAC-signed requests; WAF + bot detection.


## Friday


- Legal todos.

### Operations
- Operations: Vercel analytics, Vercel "Observability" features currently paid for
- Evaluate: hotjar, canny product request, sentry or logrocket

### User Signup
- Share URL for users to signup for private beta and get 100 free daily credits for AI predictions.



- Prediction button: User navigates to a prediction detail page. Clicks “Predict” ➞ receives an AI-generated outcome (confidence + share link). User-selectable model providers (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude) OR 2-3 will be chosen automatically by default.

### Category Fixes?
- Category fixes: Choose which categories to filter or down prioritize. consider enhancing my categories to match Polymarket's
- Decide category strategy: exclude crypto vs. mark as less effective
  - Default: include all; segment metrics per category

## Nice to have
- Data Pipeline: significantly overhaul and improve research component.
- Landing page:Track record:  "AI predicted X correctly this week".
- Add shadcdn styles and/or or framer motion animation: https://motion.dev/
- Landing page: "Today's Top Market Insights" (curated quality over quantity),
- Links to Markets, Events, internal and external on the markets, predictions and events pages are haphazard. Find a way to make them consistent.
- Add AI leaderboard?
- Add some kind of rotating banner thing to the front page to get attention. maybe create a streaming list of lowest cost (flash) predictions, updating in realtime
- Modify Market detail page to show visualization of prediction outcomes.














# Later (Date TBD)

## Enhanced Predictions Across Markets
- Trigger multiple predictions for all markets in an event at once.

## Premium Features
- "Explain Your Reasoning" — Let users drill down into why the AI made this prediction. Justify premium pricing — Deeper analysis commands higher prices than single predictions.

## Scale
- Add caching to data service layer calls? Ask the AI
- Add some lightweight test case coverage?

## Operations & Database Recovery
- Decide whether or when to upgrade Neon's PITR to 7 days?


## Revisit CRON default settings
- Consider finding a more full featured cron provider.
- Redesign CRON timings to make sense for use case.Eg
  pnpm cron:generate-batch-predictions && pnpm cron:prediction-check
  ..
  Starting batch prediction generation...
  Config: 10 markets, ±48h around 14 days from now
  Searching for markets ending between 2025-08-20T15:14:29.515Z and 2025-08-24T15:14:29.515Z
  Found 0 markets meeting criteria:
  No markets found matching the criteria


## Authentication & Rate Limiting
- Design mechanism to prevent overuse of free prediction
  - Research Google user login integration
  - Ask AI to help design rate limiting strategy
  - Implement user authentication system

## Free Prediction Features
- Enable free button inference for market prediction
  - Add temporary output to result modal window
- Enable caching for free prediction

# Public Launch Prep

## Operational
- Research best practices for rate limiting and user authentication
- Setup Database backups to Vercel Blob via GitHub actions

## Security
- Ask AI on best practices for end to end security review prior to public launch.


## Docs to author
- Basic User Guide
- Terms of Service
- Privacy Policy





# Post Launch
- [ ] Submit to Polymarket Docs for Feature: https://docs.polymarket.com/quickstart/introduction/showcase#%F0%9F%A4%9D-want-to-be-featured%3F
- []Run a small “prediction tournament” with AI‑augmented suggestions—advertise it on the Polymarket. Real traders will jump at a chance to test new tooling in a competitive environment. 

## Potential tasks
- Add shadcdn styles and/or or framer motion animation: https://motion.dev/

## Notes

## Trademark search guidance for "BetterLabs" (site: betterai.tools)

- USPTO (United States) — primary search
  - Go to the USPTO trademark search: [USPTO Trademark Search](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search)
  - Search variants (Status: Live; focus on Classes 9, 35, 42 first):
    - Exact/near-exact: `betterlabs`, `"better labs"`, `betterlab`, `"better lab"`
    - Wildcards: `better*lab*`, `better*labs*`, plus "laboratory/laboratories" variants
  - For each hit: check goods/services, owner, mark type (word vs stylized), and likelihood-of-confusion.

- International quick screen
  - WIPO Global Brand DB: [WIPO Search](https://www3.wipo.int/branddb/en/)
  - EUIPO (if EU relevant): [EUIPO](https://euipo.europa.eu/)
  - UKIPO (if UK relevant): [UKIPO](https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmtext)

- Common‑law (unregistered) use
  - Web search: combinations like `"betterlabs" software`, `"better labs" ai`, `"betterlabs" saas`
  - Social/handles: X/Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, YouTube, Product Hunt for `betterlabs` / `better labs`
  - Domains: `betterlabs.com`, `betterlabs.ai`, `better-labs.com`, etc.

- State business name checks
  - Check your formation state’s Secretary of State database for corporate name conflicts (not a trademark, but useful).

- Distinctiveness notes
  - "Better" (laudatory) + "Labs" (descriptive) may be weak; USPTO may require disclaiming "LABS".
  - A stylized/logo mark can be easier initially; pursue a word mark when feasible.

- If clearance looks okay
  - File US application (1(b) intent-to-use if not yet in commerce; 1(a) with specimen if already in use).
  - Classes likely relevant: 42 (SaaS/AI services), 9 (software) and/or 35 (business/data services) depending on scope.
  - After US filing, consider Madrid Protocol for additional countries.

- If conflicts appear
  - Options: adjust mark (e.g., to a more distinctive name), file stylized logo first, or keep "BetterLabs" as corporate name and brand products under a distinct trademark (e.g., "BetterAI").

- Quick USPTO query set (copy/paste)
  - `betterlabs`
  - `"better labs"`
  - `better*lab*`

Note: Using `betterai.tools` as the website domain is fine; the trademark clearance focuses on the mark you will register (e.g., "BetterLabs").



# Appendix

### How urgent is timing?
- **Window is open but not wide**: General-purpose AI aggregators can add “prediction-market” modes quickly. You likely have a 6–12 month window to establish data/UX moats before fast followers.
- **Ship early to compound moats**: Your strongest defenses (historical prediction lifecycle data, calibration, alpha scoring, personalization) only accrue with usage and time. Delays erode this.
- **Prioritize distribution now**: Secure traffic loops (SEO market pages, “AI vs market” leaderboards, shareable artifacts) and at least one partner integration. Distribution is harder to copy than code.

Actionable pace:
- Next 2–4 weeks: narrow v0 that proves “AI vs Market” value on a subset of categories; log full prediction lifecycle data.
- Next 6–8 weeks: ship basic calibration + “Market Alpha” score; add alerts and an Activity page to drive retention.
- Next 3–6 months: portfolio watcher “Active Agent” + factor library (“What Could Change This?”) to deepen moats.

### How easily can it be copied once public?
- **Easy to copy (weeks)**: UI, prompt scaffolding, basic multi-model calls, single-shot reasoning, public market ingestion.
- **Harder to copy (months, compounding)**:
  - End-to-end prediction dataset tied to outcomes
  - Calibration and ensembling tuned on your history
  - Proprietary “Market Alpha” signal using microstructure + external signals
  - Curated factor/event library and entity linking
  - Personalization/alerts from portfolio history
  - Cost/latency routing and caching at scale

### Defenses to implement now
- **Legal and policy**
  - ToS forbidding resale/training on outputs; API terms with quotas; DMCA-ready process.
- **Gating and egress control**
  - Auth-only access to full context; per-user/IP quotas; no bulk endpoints; HMAC-signed requests; WAF + bot detection.
- **Hold-back strategy**
  - Public: headline probability + short rationale. Logged-in: more detail. Paid: alpha score, alerts, full source bundles.
- **Artifact protection**
  - Signed expiring links, watermark shared PDFs/images, `noai,nosnippet` robots meta, share minimal reproducible seeds.
- **Keep crown jewels server-side**
  - Never expose prompts/retrieval sets/weights; only return calibrated probabilities and short explanations.
- **Moat compounding ops**
  - Nightly evaluation (Brier/log loss) + drift alerts; periodic feature rotation in alpha scoring to resist cloning.
- **Partnerships and data**
  - Secure exclusive or time-advantaged feeds where possible (curation partners, niche data sources).

If you move quickly on data capture, calibration, and distribution, you’ll be meaningfully ahead before general AI tools pivot into this niche.

- Shipped concise guidance on timing: move fast in 2–4 weeks to start compounding data moats; 6–12 month opportunity window.
- Clarified copyability: surface UI is easy to clone; lifecycle data, calibration, alpha scoring, and personalization are harder.
- Listed concrete defenses across legal, gating, hold-back, artifact protection, server-side secrecy, ops, and partnerships.
