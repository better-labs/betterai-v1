# Market prediction app

## Overview

Purpose: enable the user to invoke multiple LLMs with enriched datasets to predict the outcome of a given market (like Polymarket or Kalshi). The AI is a "coach" for the user betting on each outcome.

Thesis: 
* Everyone, regardless of their technical skill, should be able to invoke the world's best super intelligences, enriched from the best data (context), from a single mouse click, to enhance a given bet.
* Each ai platform will improve its ease of use and capability over time, but those improvements will be limited to their own models. AI aggregators like Perplexity have brought the power of multiple AIs to non-technical consumers, yet those user experience are not optimized for specific use cases.

Problem:
* The average prediction market user does not have the data or ai engineering expertise or time to maximize the use of the latest AI models.
