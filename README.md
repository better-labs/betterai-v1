# Market prediction app

## Overview

Purpose: enable the user to invoke multiple LLMs with enriched datasets to predict the outcome of a given market (like Polymarket or Kalshi). The AI is a “coach” for the user betting on each outcome.

Thesis: everyone, regardless of their technical skill, should be able to invoke the world’s best super intelligences, enriched from the best data (context), from a single mouse click, to enhance a given bet.
